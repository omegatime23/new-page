# Konark.github.io
#About the website

This is my final project for Harvard CS50x course. It's a website named “My Webpage”
Hailing from the city of temples , i thought if i did something that represented my culture
and created awareness amoung the people who atleast share the same culture as mine ,
because we are losing what our ancestors gave us .in the urge of rapid modernization we have forgetten our architecture and histoy
So with the help of technology  I wish to bridge this gap by reaching out the younger masses and letting them know what are origins are!

Thus i took up the KONARK temple which is not only an excelent piece to potray our kalinga architecture but also
holds  great geographical significance .

This website has 5 sections on the top right conner of the web page
and if u slide the arrow key you will find a smooth effect  using css.

well begining with the home icon it simply refreshes the page or redirects you back to the homepage.

Followed by the "me"section that bascically has an input text box and a submit button and by deafult it is 
set to display a message that no information regarding 
me can be diaplayed out there for this i have used java script.

Then we have the gallary that has certain images which almost covers this entire monument and I've added a pop up image effect as well as
if you minimize the screen the images adjust themsekves accordingly this is done using bootstrap.

Moving on to the about section it has the most basic information about konark and an info button at the end that leads the user to 
the wiki page where one can find all the necessay information about konark.

Then we have the contact section that has a fill up form and a submit button in this page we've used bootstrap
well if the user does not input anything inside the form then the submit button wont get enabled.

Lastly we have the watch vidio below the title that leads us to youtbe where we can type konark and watch a couple of vidios
and the "more info" option that is nothing but a gallary yet this is quite  different from the previous one as it allows the user to go to and click on 
any particular sub category of image as well.

On returning back to the home page we also have a logo on the left hand corner.

Description
Web application is based on CSS,HTML,HTTP,JavaScript,Bootstrap framework. 

How to use
To run the web application simply click on this link:

https://sahu-01.github.io/Konark.github.io/.

Requirements:
I wrote my code on visual studio code and used github pages to make a weblink so that anyone can access it.

 Possible improvements:
 * i could make the contact form using flask and database so that user can actually submit
 * i could improve the Watch Video option by directly clicking on watch video and it redirects me or takes me to the video
