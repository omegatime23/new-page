#About the website

If there is one country I really wanted to visit in South America, it was Colombiaâ€¦ The people around the world from Colombia were always so nice; The Salsa movements of this country are amazing; The Caribbean coast is known to be one of the best beach spots in the world.
This website has 5 sections on the top right conner of the web page
and if u slide the arrow key you will find a smooth effect  using css.

well begining with the home icon it simply refreshes the page or redirects you back to the homepage.

Followed by the "me"section that bascically has an input text box and a submit button and by deafult it is 
set to display a message that no information regarding 
me can be diaplayed out there for this i have used java script.

Then we have the gallary that has certain images which almost covers this entire monument and I've added a pop up image effect as well as
if you minimize the screen the images adjust themsekves accordingly this is done using bootstrap.

Moving on to the about section it has the most basic information about konark and an info button at the end that leads the user to 
the wikipedia page where one can find all the necessay information about baru.

Then we have the contact section that has a fill up form and a submit button in this page we've used bootstrap
well if the user does not input anything inside the form then the submit button wont get enabled.

Lastly we have the watch vidio below the title that leads us to youtbe.
and the "more info" option that is nothing but a gallary yet this is quite  different from the previous one as it allows the user to go to and click on 
any particular sub category of image as well.

On returning back to the home page we also have a logo on the left hand corner.
